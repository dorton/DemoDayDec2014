            <h4>About The Iron Yard Academy</h4>

            <p>The Iron Yard Academy teaches intensive, three-month courses that mentor students  into  professional junior-level programmers. Our program goes far beyond tactical skills and teaches students to think like a software engineer. Students have spent the past twelve weeks studying either Ruby on Rails Engineering or Front End Engineering and today they will present their final projects, which showcase the skills they have learned.</p>

                    <i>Front End Engineering Instructor</i>
                </p>

                <p>Matt is an Oklahama-born, Texas-raised southerner with brief Australian and British residences. He learnt programming in high school but quickly branched into scientific computing, compilers, web development, and computer security - settling with two security certifications from "the man". The remaining 90% of Matt's experience was filled with his involvement in two startups; one SXSW campaign; a healthy dose of freelance web development; an opportunity to author a few books; and several speaking arrangements at large conferences - notably <a href="#">Future of Web Apps Boston</a>, <a href="#">JSFest</a>, and <a href="#">JS.Everywhere(2013)</a>.</p>

                    <i>Ruby on Rails Instructor</i>
                </p>

                <p>JWo was not born in Texas, but got here as fast as he could, y'all. He was born in Arizona and lived in Spain, Portugal, Egypt, Kenya, and Japan &dash; all before he was 6 &dash; and was given access to a computer (8086) soon thereafter. After Dig-Dug, being the only kid in school typing reports and handing in his school reports in Lotus 123, he started to like these computer things. He programmed Perl during Web 1.0, .NET during the bust, and now Ruby and JavaScripts. Jesse has been a consultant using open source software stack for 5 years, and is an open source developer and contributor. Jesse has taught Ruby courses since 2012, authored a book on AngularJS &amp; Rails, and has loved Rails since 2007. Jesse has trained and spoke at conferences across the US, and has determined that Tacos rule and salads drool.</p>

                    <i>Campus Director</i>
                </p>

                <p>Brian Dorton is the Campus Director in Houston. He was born in Victoria, TX and moved to Houston soon after graduating from Texas A&M with a BS in Biomedical Science. He worked in education for 10 years with experience ranging from classroom teacher to campus administrator and everything in between. He received his Masters in Educational Management in 2010 from the University of Houston Clear Lake. He has had the unique opportunity to see learning take place in students as young as 5 all the way through retiring professionals. Being able to facilitate that learning, and seeing the same “ah ha” moments on the faces of students, regardless of age, is what ignites the fire in him to continue this endeavor. He is a father of two beautiful girls who take up all of his free time and he also firmly believes that that brisket is the only BBQ that should be considered BBQ.</p>

            <h5>Affluentsy</h5>

            <p>Affluentsy was inspired by a previous assignment drawing data from Etsy's API, as well as from curated lists of weird products from online stores. It pulls the most expensive items (which can often be the strangest) from the online store, and provides options for the user to curate that experience. On the site, you'll be able to view information about the product, share the item on social networks, and of course visit the actual product page on Etsy. The design of the site drew inspiration from other high-end retailers (given the nature of the products), and is built to work seamlessly on devices of all sizes.</p>

            <h5>Bling Karma</h5>

            <p>So far, there were 2 kinds of Karma in this world- Good and bad karma. Now, we officially have a third kind - "Bling Karma." :) I created Bling karma to share my love of bling, glitter and sparkle with the rest of the world and to offer a platform to purchase exclusive and exotic jewelry at a reasonable rate. Bling is more than what you wear; it is a part of who you are.</p>

            <p>Are you Bold/Creative/Whimsical/Vibrant or maybe a little bit of all of these?  Bling Karma has something for all facets of your personality!  So feed your need to bling without feeling guilty about spending way too much.  Customers can also share their reviews of the product as well as their shopping experience with the review and rating system provided by Bling Karma. Bling Karma is brought to you with the help of the following:</p>

            <h5>Chartography</h5>

            <p>Chartography is meant to make finding your next concert easy. It uses the Songkick API to provide when and where your favorite musicians are playing next. It displays all this information on a Map powered by Leaflet.js, and while your deciding about where you want to go for your next concert, you can listen to a music selection provided the Spotify Play-Button. It is an open source Ruby-on-Rails project at https://github.com/scarecrow182000/Chartography and coming soon as a live site at http://chartography.herokuapp.com/.</p>

            <p>My inspiration was <a href="https://toprubyjobs.com/">toprubyjobs.com</a>.  There is not a comparable resource available for front-end developers. Most job boards are either littered with spam jobs or inaccurate listings. A curated and brief list of the best front-end engineering jobs is sorely lacking in the community. My app will provide a minimalistic destination for any front-end developer seeking a job. Most importantly, it will provide employers a tool that bypasses employment noise and connects them to talent in the emerging field of front-end development.</p>
