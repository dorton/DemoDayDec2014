            <h4>About the Academy</h4>

            <p>The Iron Yard powered is Houston's growing code school. The school represents a unique partnership between The Iron Yard and the Houston startup and tech communities, marrying credibility and experience with a strong understanding of the local technology landscape. Simply put, all of these groups are dedicated to the lifelong pursuit of knowledge, helping the city of Houston (and the state of Texas) thrive through grassroots initiatives, and giving people, especially women and other underrepresented groups, the chance to find professional success in the technology space.</p>

            <h4>What is Demo Day?</h4>

            <p>Students with Houston's first code academy have spent the last 12 weeks learning Ruby on Rails and Front-End Engineering. Today they will present their final projects to showcase the skills they've learned. Enjoy!</p>

            <p>Cocktail Hour will come before and after Demo Day in START Houston. Appetizers and beer will be provided. We hope to see you there!</p>

                    <br>
                    <i>Front End Engineering Instructor</i>
                </p>

                <p>Matt is an Oklahama-born, Texas-raised southerner with brief Australian and British residences. He learnt programming in high school but quickly branched into scientific computing, compilers, web development, and computer security - settling with two security certifications from "the man". The remaining 90% of Matt's experience was filled with his involvement in two startups; one SXSW campaign; a healthy dose of freelance web development; an opportunity to author a few books; and several speaking arrangements at large conferences - notably <a href="#">Future of Web Apps Boston</a>, <a href="#">JSFest</a>, and <a href="#">JS.Everywhere(2013)</a>.</p>

                    <i>Ruby on Rails Instructor</i>
                </p>

                <p>JWo was not born in Texas, but got here as fast as he could, y'all. He was born in Arizona and lived in Spain, Portugal, Egypt, Kenya, and Japan &dash; all before he was 6 &dash; and was given access to a computer (8086) soon thereafter. After Dig-Dug, being the only kid in school typing reports and handing in his school reports in Lotus 123, he started to like these computer things. He programmed Perl during Web 1.0, .NET during the bust, and now Ruby and JavaScripts. Jesse has been a consultant using open source software stack for 5 years, and is an open source developer and contributor. Jesse has taught Ruby courses since 2012, authored a book on AngularJS &amp; Rails, and has loved Rails since 2007. Jesse has trained and spoke at conferences across the US, and has determined that Tacos rule and salads drool.</p>

                <p>Rich serves as The Iron Yard's Campus Director for Texas. Born and raised in South Carolina, he resides in Houston, and has plenty of roots in Texas. He often called "The Hustler" by those who know him because of his fast pace work style and ability to build relationships. He's been featured in New York Times, Entrepreneur.com, TechCrunch, Black Enterprise, and others throughout his startup career. In addition to education and tech, Rich is passionate about discovering and promoting great local food and still runs a startup called No Chains. If you live or visit Texas ask for Rich, and if nothing else you'll leave with a story to tell.</p>
