            <h4>About the Academy</h4>

            <p>The Iron Yard powered is Houston's growing code school. The school represents a unique partnership between The Iron Yard and the Houston startup and tech communities, marrying credibility and experience with a strong understanding of the local technology landscape. Simply put, all of these groups are dedicated to the lifelong pursuit of knowledge, helping the city of Houston (and the state of Texas) thrive through grassroots initiatives, and giving people, especially women and other underrepresented groups, the chance to find professional success in the technology space.</p>

                </p>

                <p>Matt is an Oklahama-born, Texas-raised southerner with brief Australian and British residences. He learnt programming in high school but quickly branched into scientific computing, compilers, web development, and computer security - settling with two security certifications from "the man". The remaining 90% of Matt's experience was filled with his involvement in two startups; one SXSW campaign; a healthy dose of freelance web development; an opportunity to author a few books; and several speaking arrangements at large conferences - notably <a href="#">Future of Web Apps Boston</a>, <a href="#">JSFest</a>, and <a href="#">JS.Everywhere(2013)</a>.</p>

                </p>

                <p>JWo was not born in Texas, but got here as fast as he could, y'all. He was born in Arizona and lived in Spain, Portugal, Egypt, Kenya, and Japan &dash; all before he was 6 &dash; and was given access to a computer (8086) soon thereafter. After Dig-Dug, being the only kid in school typing reports and handing in his school reports in Lotus 123, he started to like these computer things. He programmed Perl during Web 1.0, .NET during the bust, and now Ruby and JavaScripts. Jesse has been a consultant using open source software stack for 5 years, and is an open source developer and contributor. Jesse has taught Ruby courses since 2012, authored a book on AngularJS &amp; Rails, and has loved Rails since 2007. Jesse has trained and spoke at conferences across the US, and has determined that Tacos rule and salads drool.</p>

                <p>Rich serves as The Iron Yard's Campus Director for Texas. Born and raised in South Carolina, he resides in Houston, and has plenty of roots in Texas. He often called "The Hustler" by those who know him because of his fast pace work style and ability to build relationships. He's been featured in New York Times, Entrepreneur.com, TechCrunch, Black Enterprise, and others throughout his startup career. In addition to education and tech, Rich is passionate about discovering and promoting great local food and still runs a startup called No Chains. If you live or visit Texas ask for Rich, and if nothing else you'll leave with a story to tell.</p>

            <h5>Affluentsy</h5>

            <p>Affluentsy was inspired by a previous assignment drawing data from Etsy's API, as well as from curated lists of weird products from online stores. It pulls the most expensive items (which can often be the strangest) from the online store, and provides options for the user to curate that experience. On the site, you'll be able to view information about the product, share the item on social networks, and of course visit the actual product page on Etsy. The design of the site drew inspiration from other high-end retailers (given the nature of the products), and is built to work seamlessly on devices of all sizes.</p>

            <h5>Chartography</h5>

            <p>Chartography is meant to make finding your next concert easy. It uses the Songkick API to provide when and where your favorite musicians are playing next. It displays all this information on a Map powered by Leaflet.js, and while your deciding about where you want to go for your next concert, you can listen to a music selection provided the Spotify Play-Button. It is an open source Ruby-on-Rails project at https://github.com/scarecrow182000/Chartography and coming soon as a live site at http://chartography.herokuapp.com/.</p>

            <h5>Technologies</h5>

            <p>Foundation5 by Zurb, Leaflet.js, Songkickr, RSpotify</p>
